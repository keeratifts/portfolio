# Previous projects
The projects I have done

# Project 1: Adaptive coverage control for dynamic pattern generation
* Construct the adaptive controller for dynimic changing area
* The controller can addressed the uncertainties effect of the system.
* The coverage strategies based on Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation method

# Project 2: Autonomous Intersection Management using Control Barrier Function
* Approaches based on the Control Barrier Function are being considered as potential solutions to the problem of managing intersections. 
* The goals of these solutions are to ensure safety by reducing the likelihood of collisions and to improve the throughput of the intersection while simultaneously minimizing the amount of time that traffic is delayed.

# Project 3: Safe Adaptive Control of Multi-agent System
* Combine both adaptive controller and control barrier function
* Utilized non-uniform coverage control with density function to draw the agents toward the density center
* With control barrier function to ensure the collision among the agent despite the robot's size that the conventional method is not concern.
