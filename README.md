# Previous projects
The projects I have done

# Project 1: Adaptive coverage control for dynamic pattern generation
* Construct the adaptive controller for dynimic changing area
* The controller can addressed the uncertainties effect of the system.
* The coverage strategies based on Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation method

# Project 2: Autonomous Intersection Management using Control Barrier Function
* Approaches based on the Control Barrier Function are being considered as potential solutions to the problem of managing intersections. 
* The goals of these solutions are to ensure safety by reducing the likelihood of collisions and to improve the throughput of the intersection while simultaneously minimizing the amount of time that traffic is delayed.
